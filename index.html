<p>My three major interests and passions are Computer Science, Maths and Music, and I believe that there is a creative fusion between all these disciplines.</p>
<p>

 Being an IT Engineer from India, I have a strong academic background. After my graduation, I did several teaching jobs in colleges of India for a year, before coming to UK. In UK, I had to take up jobs not related to my field due to financial responsibilities. I soon realised that job satisfaction happens only when you have the job acknowledging your skills and competences, open for career-growth and not a dead-end one.</p>

 <p>

 I have a strong foundation knowledge of languages like C, C++ , Java, SQL , ASP.Net, Computer Networks, Database Systems, Software Development Life cycle. Working as part of a big team in my academic project taught me how teamwork is a key to success for any project. However, I never got an opportunity  to work in a real IT environment. That restricted my growth as a programmer. I believe that practical skills are most important to give you the confidence that “Yes, I can do it.”. I am hard working, responsible person and love challenges. A major recent achievement of mine has been clearing an AWS Certified Architect Associate exam by self-studying. This clearly shows my dedication towards achieving my goal and that I can do whatever it takes to further my career.</p>

 </p>


 <p>Due to family & financial responsibilities earlier, I could not give enough time to pursue my career as a web developer. Now it’s the right time to pursue my dreams and passion. I believe when you integrate your passion into what you do, you are more engaged and can create a power house of enthusiasm , engagement and inspirations for those around you.I want to get involved in designing and building real-life projects. I am striving continuously to achieve this goal. When I read about Founders & Coders online, I got very impressed with their work. I believe that Founder & Coders is a perfect platform for people like me, it would help me achieve my goal of becoming a real programmer and building up a great portfolio. I think pursuing a career in my own field and building up real applications would result in me having a fulfilling and satisfying career. </p>


 <p><b>A few fun facts about myself: </b> I love acting and bollywood dancing. When I am alone I would dance or act in front of mirror. During Summer, I enjoy playing Badminton in the park. My favourite number is 9. I love cooking. I am interested in use of Ayurveda and ancient therapies in fighting health conditions like diabetes and skin conditions. I want to build a programmable robot for my son, and gift him on his birthday. If I get selected at Founders & Coders, I would bring some ideas to make coding fun and not tiring.  </p>
